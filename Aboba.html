<p id="Abobus"><span>Types of web sites:</span><br>
Initially, the only technology that allows create websites and web pages, was html<br>
technology. However, such pages and sites were poor looking and lacked in<br>
interactivity, so in a short time that has elapsed from the start of the mass distribution of<br>
the Internet, began to be used numerous complementary technologies and languages.<br>
Static websites and web pages. Static sites and Web pages - are sites made by the<br>
classical<br>
html technology. Web pages of such sites are written entirely in the language of<br>
html and have the extension *.htm or *.html. They are called static because, gaining a<br>
certain address (URL), corresponding site or a particular page, you will always see the<br>
same content. This is because the static html-pages uploaded on the server, and at your<br>
request the server simply picks them up and sends you to the browser in without any<br>
changing.<br>
Static sites have their both pros and cons. Advantages - the ease of creating and<br>
undemanding to the hardware resources. Static sites do not require the support of scripts<br>
and databases, and can be placed on any hosting absolutely, and they will not cause<br>
almost no load on the server, and they do not have a problem when the site slows down<br>
or produces a variety of failures for a large influx of visitors. Static sites can include<br>
graphics, animation, CSS and javascript, they are great for providing information to<br>
users, which should not be vary considerably over time. The main disadvantage of static<br>
websites is the lack of interactivity. In addition, such sites are difficult in changing<br>
information, page appearance, and design.<br>
Dynamic websites and web pages. Dynamic pages do not exist in a constant kind<br>
in the server and generated by using scripts. The content and form of the dynamic pages<br>
with the same address may be completely different depending on various conditions -<br>
for example, depending on particular user’s time, current requests, etc. Web pages<br>
scripts can be written in different languages. Frequently used Web programming<br>
languages are, for example, php, perl, asp, etc. These sites can provide users with<br>
interactivity, to introduce different requests and search information within the sites,<br>
send and maintain their own information and carry out communication with other users<br>
(such as guest books, forums, etc.) and many other features. In addition, maintenance<br>
and updating of these sites much are easier. Cons of dynamic sites is that they require<br>
support for additional technologies, creating an increased load on the server, they are<br>
more difficult to optimize, in addition, scripts usage on the site is a potential threat to<br>
security.<br>

	Topic: CSS. Giving the style to your site<br>
A CSS (cascading style sheet) file allows you to separate your web sites (X)HTML<br>
content from it’s style. As always you use your (X)HTML file to arrange the content,<br>
but all of the presentation (fonts, colors, background, borders, text formatting, link<br>
effects & so on…) are accomplished within a CSS.<br>
How to create CSS file:<br>
1. Create file using any text editor (except Microsoft Word), notepad for<br>
instance.<br>
2. Fulfill your document with description of yours html page design and style<br>
using CSS format.<br>
3. Save your text document as “*.css” or you can save it as txt file and simply<br>
change extension in your file browser, to do that follow those steps:<br>
NOTE: The file should not contain any html tags.<br>
CSS Syntax<br>
A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:<br>
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block<br>
contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a<br>
CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. A CSS declaration always ends<br>
with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<br>
NOTE: Dimension values can be indicate in percents (13%) or pixels (10px).<br>
NOTE: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit (such as<br>
margin-left: 20 px;). The correct way is: margin-left: 20px;</p></div>
